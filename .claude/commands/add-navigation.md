Create a responsive navigation system with modern features.

Generate:
- Header component with navigation bar using Bootstrap navbar
- Mobile hamburger menu with smooth toggle animation
- Dropdown menu support for nested navigation items
- Active link highlighting using Next.js usePathname hook
- Next.js Link components for client-side navigation
- TypeScript types for navigation structure
- Navigation data structure (array of nav items with labels, paths, children)
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Sticky header option
- Mobile-first responsive design with Bootstrap breakpoints

Include proper semantic HTML (nav, ul, li), smooth animations, and support for external links. Ensure menu closes on route change and works with screen readers.
