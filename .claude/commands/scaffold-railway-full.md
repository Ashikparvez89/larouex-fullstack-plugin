Create a complete Railway full-stack application with modern architecture.

Build a production-ready application with:
- Next.js 15 frontend with App Router, TypeScript, and Bootstrap 5
- Express/Node.js backend API with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM setup
- Redis for caching and session management
- Separate Railway services: web (Next.js), api (Express), database, redis
- Environment-specific configuration for staging and production
- railway.toml for each service with proper configuration
- Database migrations with Prisma
- API client utilities in Next.js for calling Express API
- Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend
- Comprehensive README.md with architecture and Railway deployment guide

Include health checks, logging, error handling, and Railway service linking configuration.
