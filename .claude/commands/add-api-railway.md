Create a new Express API endpoint with full integration.

Generate:
- Express route handler in /server/api with TypeScript
- Input validation using express-validator or Zod
- Comprehensive error handling middleware
- CORS configuration in Express app
- Database integration with Prisma ORM
- Request/response TypeScript interfaces
- API client code in Next.js (/lib/api) for calling the endpoint
- Environment variable configuration
- Example usage in a Next.js component
- API documentation comments

Include proper middleware chain (validation, authentication, error handling), logging, security headers, and RESTful conventions. Ensure rate limiting and request validation are in place.
