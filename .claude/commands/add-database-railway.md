Set up PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and complete data layer.

Create:
- Prisma schema with models, relations, and indexes (schema.prisma)
- Database migrations using Prisma Migrate
- Prisma client initialization with connection pooling
- CRUD operations in Express API routes
- Query helpers for complex database operations
- Railway database environment variable configuration (DATABASE_URL)
- Database seeding script for development data
- Error handling for database operations (unique constraint, not found, timeout)
- Database utility functions in /server/utils
- README.md with database schema documentation

Include proper transaction handling, connection pooling configuration, and best practices for Prisma queries. Set up Railway PostgreSQL plugin if needed.
