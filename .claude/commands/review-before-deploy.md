Execute comprehensive pre-deployment review using code-review-agent with all relevant platform agents. Run complete deployment readiness checklist: verify all tests pass (unit, integration, E2E), security audit clean (no Critical/High issues), performance benchmarks met (Lighthouse > 90), TypeScript compilation successful, ESLint clean, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), documentation updated, environment variables configured, database migrations tested, rollback plan documented, monitoring configured (Application Insights or Railway logs), error tracking enabled, staging environment validated, and browser compatibility verified. Check platform-specific deployment requirements (Azure staticwebapp.config.json or Railway railway.toml/Dockerfile). Provide GO/NO-GO recommendation with justification. Output critical blockers that must be resolved before production deployment. Require manual confirmation to proceed.
