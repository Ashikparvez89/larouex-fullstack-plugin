Analyze and optimize JavaScript bundle size. Run @next/bundle-analyzer to visualize bundle composition. Implement code splitting with dynamic imports for large components. Add route-based code splitting for page components. Remove unused dependencies from package.json. Configure tree shaking in next.config.ts. Optimize third-party library imports (use specific imports instead of entire libraries). Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components. Measure bundle size before and after optimizations. Provide detailed report with size reductions. Set bundle size budgets for future monitoring.
