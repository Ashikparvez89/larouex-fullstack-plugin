Review an API endpoint using code-review-agent with azure-serverless-agent or devops-railway-agent based on deployment target. Analyze input validation (Zod schemas), authentication and authorization, rate limiting, CORS configuration, error handling with proper HTTP status codes, security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS), database query optimization (N+1 prevention), response caching strategies, structured logging, and API documentation. Check platform-specific patterns: Azure Functions (host.json, bindings, Application Insights) or Express routes (middleware, error handlers). Provide security-focused recommendations with code examples. Specify the API file path after the command. Output includes critical security findings, performance optimizations, and compliance with REST/OpenAPI standards.
