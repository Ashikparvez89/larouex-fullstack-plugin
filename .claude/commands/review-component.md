Review a specific React component file using code-review-agent and frontend-development-agent. Analyze component architecture, proper Server vs Client component usage, prop types, hooks patterns (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo), accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation), performance optimizations (React.memo, code splitting), Bootstrap 5 responsive design, error boundaries, and loading states. Check for prop drilling, unnecessary re-renders, and testability. Provide component-specific best practices with code examples. Specify the component file path after the command. Output includes severity-rated findings, quick fixes, and refactoring suggestions to improve maintainability and user experience.
