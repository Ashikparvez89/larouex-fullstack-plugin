Perform comprehensive security audit of the current project.

Analyze and report on:
- Common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, command injection)
- Environment variable exposure and secrets management
- CORS configuration and potential security issues
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- API endpoint security (rate limiting, authentication)
- Dependency vulnerabilities using npm audit or similar
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.)
- Session management and token storage
- SQL/database query security
- File upload security if applicable
- HTTPS enforcement
- Error message information disclosure

Provide specific recommendations with code examples for each finding. Prioritize issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low). Include remediation steps.
