Generate comprehensive tests for a component or API endpoint.

Create test suite with:
- Unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library (for components) or Jest (for API)
- Test file in proper location (__tests__ or .test.ts/.test.tsx)
- Test setup with necessary mocks and fixtures
- Render tests for different component states and props
- Interaction tests (clicks, form input, keyboard navigation)
- Integration tests for component with API calls
- Accessibility tests using jest-axe
- Edge case and error scenario tests
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Test coverage for all exported functions/components

Include proper test descriptions, assertions, and cleanup. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert). Ensure tests are isolated and deterministic.
