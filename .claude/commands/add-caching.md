Implement comprehensive caching strategy across the application. Configure CDN caching headers in staticwebapp.config.json or Railway configuration. Set cache-control headers for static assets (immutable for hashed files). Implement static generation with revalidation using Next.js ISR. Add client-side caching with SWR or React Query for API responses. Configure stale-while-revalidate patterns. Implement service worker for offline support and asset caching. Add cache versioning strategy. Document cache invalidation procedures for deployments. Test caching behavior in production. Measure performance improvements with faster load times.
