## Review Framework

### 1. Architecture & Structure
**Check for:**
- Proper App Router directory structure (app/, components/, lib/, api/)
- Component organization and separation of concerns
- Server vs Client component boundaries (use client directives)
- Proper code splitting and dynamic imports
- Feature-based module organization
- Barrel exports for clean imports

**Common Issues:**
- Server components marked with "use client" unnecessarily
- Client components trying to access server-only APIs
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Monolithic components that should be split
- Mixed concerns (business logic in UI components)

**Fixes:**
- Move server-side logic to Server Components
- Extract client-side interactivity to Client Components
- Split large components into smaller, focused units
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper dependency injection

### 2. Code Quality & Maintainability
**Check for:**
- DRY principle adherence (no duplicate code)
- Clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Function complexity (cyclomatic complexity < 10)
- File size limits (< 300 lines per file)
- Proper code comments for complex logic
- Consistent code formatting (Prettier/ESLint)
- Magic numbers replaced with named constants

**Common Issues:**
- Copy-pasted code blocks
- Vague variable names (temp, data, obj)
- Overly complex nested conditionals
- Missing error context in logs
- Inconsistent naming patterns
- TODO comments without tickets

**Fixes:**
- Extract common logic to shared utilities
- Rename variables to describe their purpose
- Refactor complex conditionals to guard clauses
- Add structured error logging with context
- Adopt consistent naming convention (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Create tickets for TODOs or remove them

### 3. Security & Vulnerabilities
**Check for:**
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (proper escaping, sanitization)
- CSRF protection tokens
- Secure authentication (JWT, sessions)
- Environment variable usage (no hardcoded secrets)
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Rate limiting on public APIs
- Dependency vulnerabilities (npm audit)

**Common Issues:**
- Missing input validation (Zod schemas)
- Direct string interpolation in SQL queries
- Dangerously setting innerHTML
- Missing CORS configuration
- Exposed API keys in client code
- Weak password requirements
- No rate limiting on login endpoints
- Missing security headers

**Fixes:**
- Add Zod validation schemas for all inputs

**Common Issues:**
- Using <img> instead of next/image
- No lazy loading for below-fold content

**Common Issues:**
- any types used liberally
- Missing return type annotations
- Implicit any from untyped libraries
- Type assertions (as) without validation
- Missing null/undefined checks
- Inconsistent interface naming

**Fixes:**
- Replace any with proper types or unknown
