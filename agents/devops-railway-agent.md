## Railway Environment Setup

### Creating Separate Environments

**Best Practice: Isolated Environments**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Create staging environment
railway environment --create staging

# Create production environment
railway environment --create production

# List all environments
railway environment
```

**Environment Switching**
```bash
# Switch to staging
railway environment staging

# Switch to production
railway environment production

# Deploy to specific environment
railway up --environment staging
railway up --environment production
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

**Critical Pattern: Environment Variables Per Environment**

1. **Staging Environment Variables**
```bash
# Switch to staging
railway environment staging

# Set staging-specific variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=staging
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
railway variables set API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.example.com
railway variables set LOG_LEVEL=debug
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_MAX=1000
```

2. **Production Environment Variables**
```bash
# Switch to production
railway environment production

# Set production-specific variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
railway variables set API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
railway variables set LOG_LEVEL=error
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
```

### Railway.toml Configuration

**Multi-Environment Railway Configuration**
```toml
# railway.toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

# Staging-specific overrides
[environments.staging]
[environments.staging.deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start:staging"

# Production-specific overrides
[environments.production]
[environments.production.deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start:production"
numReplicas = 2
```

## Database Provisioning

### PostgreSQL Setup

**Per-Environment Databases**
```bash
# Staging environment
railway environment staging
railway add --plugin postgresql

# Production environment
railway environment production
railway add --plugin postgresql
```

**Database Connection Pattern**
```javascript
// config/database.js
const getDatabaseConfig = () => {
  const env = process.env.RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT || 'development';

  return {
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    ssl: env === 'production' ? { rejectUnauthorized: false } : false,
    max: env === 'production' ? 20 : 10,
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
    connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
  };
};

module.exports = getDatabaseConfig();
```

### Redis Provisioning

**Cache Layer Setup**
```bash
# Add Redis to staging
railway environment staging
railway add --plugin redis

# Add Redis to production
railway environment production
railway add --plugin redis
```

**Redis Configuration**
```javascript
// config/redis.js
const redis = require('redis');

const client = redis.createClient({
  url: process.env.REDIS_URL,
  socket: {
    connectTimeout: 5000,
    reconnectStrategy: (retries) => {
      if (retries > 10) return new Error('Max retries reached');
      return Math.min(retries * 100, 3000);
    }
  }
});

module.exports = client;
```

## Custom Domains and SSL

### Domain Configuration

**Setting Up Custom Domains**
```bash
# Staging domain
railway environment staging
railway domain add staging.example.com

# Production domain
railway environment production
railway domain add example.com
railway domain add www.example.com
```

**SSL Certificate Management**
- Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Certificates auto-renew before expiration
- Custom certificates can be uploaded via dashboard

**DNS Configuration**
```text
# For root domain (example.com)
Type: A
Name: @
Value: [Railway IP from dashboard]

# For www subdomain
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [Railway domain from dashboard]

# For staging subdomain
Type: CNAME
Name: staging
Value: [Railway staging domain]
```

## Monorepo and Multi-Service Deployments

### Monorepo Setup

**Railway Service Configuration**
```toml
# apps/api/railway.toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm run build --workspace=api"
watchPaths = ["apps/api/**"]

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start --workspace=api"

# apps/web/railway.toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm run build --workspace=web"
watchPaths = ["apps/web/**"]

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start --workspace=web"
```

**Multi-Service Deployment Strategy**
```bash
# Deploy API service
cd apps/api
railway up --service api

# Deploy Web service
cd apps/web
railway up --service web

# Deploy Worker service
cd apps/worker
railway up --service worker
```

### Service Dependencies

**Internal Service Communication**
```javascript
// Use Railway private networking
const API_INTERNAL_URL = process.env.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN
  ? `http://${process.env.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}:${process.env.PORT}`
  : process.env.API_URL;

// Service-to-service communication
const response = await fetch(`${API_INTERNAL_URL}/internal/data`);
```

## Private Networking

### Configuring Private Networks

**Enable Private Networking**
```bash
# Private networking is automatically available
# Access services via: servicename.railway.internal
```

**Private Network Usage**
```javascript
// config/services.js
const getServiceUrls = () => {
  const isRailway = process.env.RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT;

  return {
    apiUrl: isRailway
      ? 'http://api.railway.internal:3000'
      : 'http://localhost:3000',

    workerUrl: isRailway
      ? 'http://worker.railway.internal:4000'
      : 'http://localhost:4000',
  };
};
```

## Volume and Persistent Storage

### Volume Configuration

**Creating Volumes**
```bash
# Via CLI (dashboard preferred for volumes)
# Volumes persist data across deployments

# Mount point configuration in railway.toml
[deploy]
volumes = [
  { name = "uploads", mountPath = "/app/uploads" },
  { name = "cache", mountPath = "/app/cache" }
]
```

**Volume Usage Patterns**
```javascript
// services/storage.js
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const path = require('path');

const UPLOAD_DIR = process.env.RAILWAY_VOLUME_UPLOADS_PATH || './uploads';

const saveFile = async (filename, data) => {
  const filepath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, filename);
  await fs.writeFile(filepath, data);
  return filepath;
};

module.exports = { saveFile };
```

## Deployment Triggers

### Git-Based Deployment

**Automatic Deployments**
```bash
# Configure branch-based deployments in Railway dashboard
# Staging: deploy from 'develop' branch
# Production: deploy from 'main' branch
```

**Manual Deployment Control**
```bash
# Disable auto-deploy and deploy manually
railway up

# Deploy specific commit
railway up --commit abc123

# Deploy from local directory
railway up --detach
```

### Deployment Webhooks

**Triggering Deployments**
```bash
# Get webhook URL from Railway dashboard
curl -X POST https://railway.app/api/webhooks/deploy/[project-id]
```

## Health Checks and Monitoring

### Health Check Configuration

**Implementing Health Endpoints**
```javascript
// routes/health.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const checks = {
    database: await checkDatabase(),
    redis: await checkRedis(),
    disk: await checkDiskSpace(),
  };

  const isHealthy = Object.values(checks).every(c => c.status === 'ok');
  const statusCode = isHealthy ? 200 : 503;

  res.status(statusCode).json({
    status: isHealthy ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy',
    environment: process.env.RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT,
    checks,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Railway Health Check Config**
```toml
[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

### Monitoring Best Practices

**Structured Logging**
```javascript
// utils/logger.js
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  defaultMeta: {
    service: process.env.RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME,
    environment: process.env.RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT,
  },
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console({
      format: winston.format.simple(),
    }),
  ],
});

module.exports = logger;
```

## Log Aggregation

### Railway Logs Access

**CLI Log Access**
```bash
# View recent logs
railway logs

# Follow logs in real-time
railway logs --follow

# Filter logs by service
railway logs --service api

# Filter by environment
railway environment production
railway logs --follow
```

**Log Management Strategies**
```javascript
// middleware/logging.js
const logger = require('../utils/logger');

const requestLogger = (req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();

  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;

    logger.info('HTTP Request', {
      method: req.method,
      path: req.path,
      statusCode: res.statusCode,
      duration,
      userAgent: req.get('user-agent'),
      ip: req.ip,
    });
  });

  next();
};

module.exports = requestLogger;
```

## Pricing Optimization

### Cost Management Strategies

**Resource Optimization Checklist**
- [ ] Use sleep mode for non-critical staging environments
- [ ] Right-size database instances (shared vs dedicated)
- [ ] Implement aggressive caching to reduce compute
- [ ] Use private networking to reduce egress costs
- [ ] Monitor usage metrics regularly
- [ ] Remove unused services and plugins
- [ ] Optimize build times to reduce build minutes
- [ ] Use volume storage efficiently

**Environment-Specific Scaling**
```toml
# Staging: minimal resources
[environments.staging.deploy]
numReplicas = 1

# Production: scaled resources
[environments.production.deploy]
numReplicas = 2
```

## Environment Promotion Workflow

### Staging to Production Process

**Pre-Promotion Checklist**
- [ ] All staging tests passing
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Environment variables verified
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

**Promotion Strategy**

```bash
# 1. Test in staging
railway environment staging
railway up
# Verify deployment

# 2. Run smoke tests
npm run test:smoke -- --env=staging

# 3. Promote to production
railway environment production

# 4. Update production environment variables if needed
railway variables set NEW_FEATURE_FLAG=true

# 5. Deploy to production
railway up

# 6. Monitor production logs
railway logs --follow

# 7. Verify production health
curl https://example.com/health
```

**Database Migration Pattern**
```bash
# 1. Run migrations in staging
railway environment staging
railway run npm run migrate

# 2. Verify data integrity
railway run npm run verify:data

# 3. Run migrations in production
railway environment production
railway run npm run migrate

# 4. Deploy application
railway up
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --build

# Common fixes:
# 1. Verify buildCommand in railway.toml
# 2. Check Node.js version compatibility
# 3. Verify dependencies in package.json
# 4. Clear build cache via dashboard
```

**Issue: Environment Variable Not Found**
```bash
# List all variables in current environment
railway variables

# Verify environment
railway environment

# Set missing variable
railway variables set VAR_NAME=value
```

**Issue: Database Connection Failures**
```javascript
// Add connection retry logic
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: 20,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 5000,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }
});

pool.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Unexpected database error', err);
});
```

**Issue: Service Won't Start**
```bash
# Check service logs
railway logs --service servicename

# Verify start command
railway run echo $PORT

# Test locally with same environment
railway run npm start
```

**Issue: Domain Not Resolving**
```bash
# Verify DNS propagation
dig example.com
nslookup example.com

# Check Railway domain status in dashboard
# Verify SSL certificate provisioned
# Allow 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
```

### Performance Troubleshooting

**Slow Response Times**
```javascript
// Add performance monitoring
const perf = require('perf_hooks').performance;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = perf.now();

  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = perf.now() - start;
    if (duration > 1000) {
      logger.warn('Slow request', {
        path: req.path,
        duration
      });
    }
  });

  next();
});
```

**Memory Issues**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
railway logs | grep "memory"

# Increase memory allocation via dashboard
# Check for memory leaks
railway run node --inspect app.js
```

## Best Practices

### Deployment Best Practices

1. **Always Use Separate Environments**
   - Never test in production
   - Staging should mirror production configuration
   - Use environment-specific variables

2. **Version Control Configuration**
   - Commit railway.toml to repository
   - Document environment variables in .env.example
   - Never commit secrets

3. **Database Management**
   - Always backup before migrations
   - Test migrations in staging first
   - Use connection pooling

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implement structured logging
   - Set up health check endpoints
   - Monitor resource usage regularly

5. **Security**
   - Use Railway's private networking
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use environment-specific API keys

### Configuration Management

**Template .env.example**
```bash
# Application
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Database (provided by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}

# Redis (provided by Railway)
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}

# Application Secrets
JWT_SECRET=
API_KEY=
ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE=false

# External Services
STRIPE_API_KEY=
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Blue-Green Deployment on Railway

```bash
# Create blue environment (current production)
railway environment production

# Create green environment (new version)
railway environment production-green
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
# Copy all production variables to green

# Deploy to green
railway up --environment production-green

# Test green environment
# Once validated, update DNS to point to green

# After verification, green becomes new production
# Keep blue as rollback option
```

### Canary Deployment Pattern

```javascript
// Load balancer configuration
const CANARY_PERCENTAGE = parseInt(process.env.CANARY_PERCENTAGE || '0');

const shouldUseCanary = () => {
  return Math.random() * 100 < CANARY_PERCENTAGE;
};

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (shouldUseCanary()) {
    req.headers['x-canary'] = 'true';
  }
  next();
});
```
