Audit the project for WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance.

Analyze and report on:
- Semantic HTML usage (header, nav, main, article, section, footer)
- ARIA labels, roles, and attributes on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support (tab order, focus management, skip links)
- Color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility and announcements
- Form accessibility (labels, error messages, required fields)
- Image alt text and decorative image handling
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- Heading hierarchy (h1-h6 proper structure)
- Link text clarity (avoid "click here")
- Button vs link semantic correctness
- Mobile touch target sizes
- Motion and animation (prefers-reduced-motion)

Provide specific fixes with code examples for each issue. Test with automated tools (jest-axe, Lighthouse). Include manual testing recommendations.
