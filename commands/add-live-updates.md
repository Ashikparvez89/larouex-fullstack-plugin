Implement live data updates without WebSockets. Use SWR or React Query for automatic polling and revalidation. Configure polling intervals based on data freshness requirements. Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for one-way real-time updates from server. Add optimistic UI updates for immediate user feedback. Handle stale data with background refetching. Show connection status indicator to users. Implement focus-based revalidation when user returns to tab. Add manual refresh trigger. Create smart polling that stops when user is idle. Provide examples: live notifications, real-time metrics, status updates. Handle network errors gracefully with retry logic.
