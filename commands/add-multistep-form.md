Create a multi-step form wizard with progress tracking and validation.

Generate:
- Multi-step form component with step navigation
- Progress indicator showing current step and completion
- Step-by-step validation (validate before moving to next step)
- Navigation buttons (Next, Previous, Submit) with proper states
- Form state persistence across steps using React Hook Form or context
- TypeScript types for each step's data
- Step components for each form section
- Review/summary step before final submission
- Error handling per step with accessible messages
- Mobile-responsive design with Bootstrap
- Accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements)

Include save progress functionality, step skipping logic if applicable, and comprehensive form state management.
