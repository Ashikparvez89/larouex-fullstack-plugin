Scaffold a basic Next.js 15 project with modern best practices.

Create a clean starting point with:
- Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- Bootstrap 5 integration with custom SCSS variables
- Responsive layout component with header, main, and footer
- Component structure in /components with common UI elements
- TypeScript configuration optimized for Next.js
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Basic page examples: home, about, contact
- Custom fonts and global styles
- Image optimization setup
- Environment variable configuration (.env.local template)
- package.json with useful scripts
- Comprehensive README.md

No platform-specific deployment configuration. Focus on clean code architecture and developer experience.
