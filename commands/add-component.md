Create a reusable React component with TypeScript and best practices.

Generate:
- Component file in /components with proper naming convention
- TypeScript interface for component props with JSDoc comments
- Responsive Bootstrap styling with custom CSS if needed
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)
- Props validation and default values
- Component variants or modes if applicable
- Example usage documentation in comments
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Storybook story (if Storybook is configured)

Include proper error handling, loading states if needed, and mobile-first responsive design. Export component with named export. Focus on reusability and composability.
