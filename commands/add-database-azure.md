Set up Azure Table Storage with complete data layer implementation.

Create:
- Table Storage entity schema with TypeScript interfaces (PartitionKey, RowKey, properties)
- Table Storage client utility with connection string configuration
- CRUD operations in Azure Functions: Create, Read, Update, Delete, List with pagination
- Query helpers for complex Table Storage queries
- Error handling for Table Storage operations (conflict, not found, timeout)
- Entity validation before storage operations
- Connection string configuration in local.settings.json
- Environment variable setup for Azure deployment
- Comprehensive logging with Application Insights integration
- README.md documentation for data model

Include proper transaction handling, batch operations support, and best practices for partition key design.
