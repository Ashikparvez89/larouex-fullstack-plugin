Create Playwright end-to-end test for a complete user flow.

Generate:
- E2E test file in /e2e or /tests/e2e
- Page Object Model classes for pages under test
- Test fixtures for test data and setup
- Complete user flow test (e.g., registration, checkout, form submission)
- Assertions for UI elements, navigation, and data persistence
- Screenshot capture on test failure
- Test setup and teardown (before/after hooks)
- Environment configuration for test URLs
- Happy path test scenario
- Edge case and error scenario tests
- Mobile viewport testing

Include proper waiting strategies (waitForSelector, waitForNavigation), robust selectors, and test isolation. Cover authentication flows if needed. Ensure tests are maintainable and well-documented.
