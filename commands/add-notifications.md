Create a toast notification system for user feedback. Implement notification context with React Context API for global state. Create toast component styled with Bootstrap alert variants (success, error, warning, info). Add auto-dismiss functionality with configurable timeout. Support manual close button. Implement notification queue for multiple simultaneous toasts. Add slide-in animations with CSS transitions. Position notifications in top-right corner with fixed positioning. Include accessibility features: ARIA live regions, keyboard dismissal. Provide simple API: notify.success(), notify.error(), etc. Add usage examples throughout the application. Make notifications responsive for mobile devices.
