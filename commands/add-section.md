Create a reusable page section component with responsive design.

Generate:
- Section component in /components/sections
- TypeScript interface for section props (title, subtitle, content, image, CTA)
- Responsive Bootstrap grid layout (container, row, col)
- Multiple section variants: hero, features, testimonials, pricing, CTA
- Content props with flexible structure
- Image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Background options (color, gradient, image)
- Spacing and padding controls
- Call-to-action button integration
- Example usage with sample content

Make the section highly customizable and reusable. Include proper semantic HTML (section, article), accessibility features, and mobile-first responsive design. Support both Server and Client Components.
