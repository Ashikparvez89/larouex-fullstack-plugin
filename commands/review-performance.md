Analyze application performance using code-review-agent and monitoring-observability-agent. Check Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1), bundle size analysis, image optimization (next/image, WebP format), font optimization (next/font), code splitting and lazy loading, caching strategies (stale-while-revalidate), database query efficiency (indexes, N+1 prevention), unnecessary re-renders, and prefetching strategies. Analyze Lighthouse CI scores across mobile and desktop. Review platform-specific performance: Azure (Application Insights metrics, cold starts) or Railway (resource limits, scaling). Provide prioritized optimization recommendations with estimated impact on load time and user experience. Include specific code examples for quick wins and long-term improvements.
